# React Tours

Despite being a simple project, React Tours has been instrumental in improving my React skills and boosting my speed in working with the framework. The project's modular structure allows users to browse tourist destinations and remove any unwanted data. Additionally, React Tours fetches data from an API, making it an excellent exercise for learning how to work with external data sources. By building React Tours, I have been able to develop my proficiency with React and work more efficiently in my development environment.
