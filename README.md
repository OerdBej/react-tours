# React Tours

React Tours is a simple project that has helped me improve my React skills and work faster. Its modular structure lets you browse tourist destinations and remove any unwanted data. You can also learn how to work with external data sources since it fetches data from an API. Building React Tours has allowed me to develop my proficiency with React and work more efficiently. Overall, React Tours is a great tool for exploring and learning about tourist destinations, with features like removing unwanted data and refreshing the latest information from the API, while keeping you informed with the spinner feature while the data is loading.
